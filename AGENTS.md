# Agent Development Guidelines

This repository supports AI-powered development workflows. Please follow these guidelines for contributing.

## Development Environment Setup

The project is automatically configured for AI agents through the `.codex/setup.sh` script which:

- Checks Swift and Xcode versions
- Resolves package dependencies  
- Validates build environment
- Provides system information for context

## Agent Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**: The setup script runs automatically when agents access the repository
2. **Build Commands**: Use `./Scripts/build.sh` for optimized builds
3. **Testing**: Use `./Scripts/test.sh` for comprehensive testing
4. **Development**: Follow the Phase-based development timeline in the PRD

## Project Structure

- `Sources/AutomationCore/` - Core automation framework
- `Sources/XcodeAutomationServer/` - Main executable  
- `Tests/` - Test suites
- `Scripts/` - Build and development helpers
- `Documentation/` - Comprehensive project docs

## Key Guidelines

- Follow the comprehensive PRD for architectural decisions
- Implement security-first patterns with App Sandbox compliance
- Optimize for Mac Studio M2 Max performance (85-90% utilization)
- Use Swift structured concurrency with actors
- Maintain compatibility with Swift 6.0+ and macOS 14+

## Development Phases

- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Foundation + Core Extraction ‚Üê **Current**
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): Enhanced Swift Implementation  
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): Advanced Features + Optimization
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 7-8): Security Hardening + Production

For detailed implementation guidance, see the comprehensive PRD and Documentation folder.
