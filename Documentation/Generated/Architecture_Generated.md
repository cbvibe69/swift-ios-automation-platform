# Swift iOS Automation Platform Architecture

The platform is built with a modular architecture focused on performance, security, and extensibility.

## Core Principles
- **Zero Network Exposure**: Stdio transport only
- **Mac Studio M2 Max Optimized**: 85-90% resource utilization
- **Real-time Intelligence**: File monitoring and change analysis
- **App Sandbox Compliant**: Complete security framework

## Components

### AutomationCore

Core automation engine with MCP server, tool handlers, and intelligence systems

**Dependencies:**
- SwiftMCP
- Logging

### XcodeAutomationServer

Server entry point and configuration management

**Dependencies:**
- AutomationCore

## Data Flow

```
[Client] <-> [MCP Protocol] <-> [Tool Handlers] <-> [Xcode/Simulator]
                                      |
                            [File Monitor] <-> [Build Intelligence]
```

Data flows through the MCP protocol layer to specialized tool handlers that interact with 
Xcode and iOS simulators while maintaining real-time file monitoring and build intelligence.
