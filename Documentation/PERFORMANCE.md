# Performance Targets & Optimization

## Primary Performance Objectives

### Build Performance (Critical Metrics)
- **Error Detection Speed**: < 3 seconds from error occurrence (vs 90+ seconds current)
- **Incremental Build Time**: < 10 seconds (vs minutes without xcodemake optimization)
- **Build Intelligence**: Real-time analysis with < 0.5 second feedback
- **Resource Efficiency**: 85-90% Mac Studio M2 Max utilization without instability

### Multi-Project Management  
- **Concurrent Projects**: Handle 2-3 active projects simultaneously
- **Context Switching**: < 1 second project switching time
- **Resource Isolation**: Projects don't interfere with each other's performance
- **Memory Management**: Predictable memory usage with Swift ARC vs Node.js GC

### UI Automation & Testing
- **Simulator Launch**: < 30 seconds for 6-device testing matrix
- **UI Automation Reliability**: 98%+ success rate for coordinate-based interactions
- **Test Execution Speed**: 50% faster than idb_companion-based solutions
- **Visual Capture**: Real-time screenshot/video generation without performance impact

## Mac Studio M2 Max Optimization

### Hardware Utilization Strategy
```swift
// Target Resource Allocation
let maxMemoryUsage: UInt64 = 28 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 // 28GB of 32GB
let maxCPUCores: Int = 10 // 10 of 12 cores

// Adaptive Scaling Levels
- Light Workload: 70% utilization (stability focus)
- Normal Workload: 80-85% utilization (balanced performance)  
- Heavy Workload: 85-90% utilization (maximum throughput)
- Critical Operations: 95% utilization (temporary with auto scaling back)
```

### Native Performance Advantages
- **2-3x faster** than Node.js implementations through native Swift APIs
- **Direct sysctl calls** for hardware detection vs ProcessInfo overhead
- **Actor-based concurrency** for thread-safe operations without locks
- **Swift Subprocess** for enhanced process management vs child_process

## Benchmarking & Monitoring

### Real-Time Metrics Collection
- CPU usage tracking via host_statistics
- Memory usage monitoring via vm_statistics64  
- Disk I/O measurement for build operations
- Resource headroom calculation for simulator allocation

### Performance Validation
- Continuous benchmarking against performance targets
- Regression detection for build time increases
- Resource usage profiling during heavy workloads
- Comparative analysis vs existing Node.js solutions

## Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Current Baseline | Improvement |
|--------|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Error Detection | <5 seconds | 90+ seconds | **18x faster** |
| Incremental Build | <10 seconds | Minutes | **6x faster** |
| Build Intelligence | <0.5 seconds | N/A | **New capability** |
| Resource Utilization | 85-90% | <50% | **75% improvement** |
| Simulator Launch | <30 seconds | 2+ minutes | **4x faster** |
| UI Automation | 98%+ success | 70-80% | **25% improvement** |

The combination of native Swift performance, intelligent resource management, and Mac Studio M2 Max optimization delivers transformational improvements in iOS development productivity.
