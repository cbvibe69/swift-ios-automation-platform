### Task 10: Create Performance Benchmarking System
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Optimization tracking

**Description:** Implement performance benchmarking to track build times, resource usage, and identify optimization opportunities.

**Files to Create:**
- `Sources/AutomationCore/Performance/BenchmarkRunner.swift`
- `Sources/AutomationCore/Performance/PerformanceProfiler.swift`

**Specific Actions:**
1. Implement `BenchmarkRunner` for standardized performance testing:
   - Build time measurements
   - Resource usage profiling
   - Comparative analysis over time
2. Create `PerformanceProfiler` for detailed profiling:
   - CPU usage during builds
   - Memory allocation patterns
   - Disk I/O analysis
3. Add baseline establishment for Mac Studio M2 Max
4. Create MCP tools for performance analysis

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Automated performance benchmarking
- Historical performance tracking
- Identification of performance regressions
