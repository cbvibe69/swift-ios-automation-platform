### Task 13: Implement Enhanced UI Automation Framework
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Testing capabilities

**Description:** Create native UI automation capabilities that surpass `idb_companion` by leveraging Swift's native Accessibility APIs.

**Files to Create:**
- `Sources/AutomationCore/UIAutomation/AccessibilityAutomation.swift`
- `Sources/AutomationCore/UIAutomation/UITestExecutor.swift`

**Specific Actions:**
1. Implement `AccessibilityAutomation` using native APIs:
   - Direct `AXUIElement` manipulation
   - Coordinate-based interactions
   - Element discovery and inspection
2. Create `UITestExecutor` for complex scenarios:
   - Multi-step test execution
   - Screenshot capture integration
   - Performance measurement during tests
3. Add support for both simulator and device automation
4. Create MCP tools for UI automation operations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Native accessibility API integration
- More reliable than idb_companion-based solutions
- Support for complex multi-step UI scenarios
