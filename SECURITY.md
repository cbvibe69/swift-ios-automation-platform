# Security Policy

## Sandbox Strategy
- **App Sandbox**: All automation runs inside the macOS App Sandbox.
- **User-controlled permissions**: File and network access require explicit approval using security bookmarks.
- **Local processing**: Build data never leaves your machine unless explicitly configured.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please create a private GitHub security advisory or email `security@example.com`. We will respond as quickly as possible.
